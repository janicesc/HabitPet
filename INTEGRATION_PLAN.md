# Safe Integration Plan - Adding Calorie Camera to HabitPet

## 🎯 Goal
Merge your calorie camera feature into her HabitPet iOS app **without breaking** her existing code.

## 📊 Current Situation

**Her Repo (friend/main)**:
- `HabitPet.xcodeproj` - Her iOS app
- `HabitPet/` - iOS source files
- `supabase/functions/analyze_food/` - Basic version
- No web app, no Swift package

**Your Local Code (main)**:
- ❌ `HabitPet.xcodeproj` - DELETED (would break her app!)
- ✅ `src/`, `public/` - Next.js web app (NEW)
- ✅ `calorie-camera/` - Swift package (NEW)
- ✅ `CalorieCameraHost/` - Demo iOS app (NEW)
- ✅ Enhanced `supabase/functions/analyze_food/` (IMPROVED)
- ✅ Documentation files (NEW)

## ⚠️ The Problem

If you push directly, it will:
1. ❌ Delete her `HabitPet.xcodeproj`
2. ❌ Delete her `HabitPet/` source folder
3. ❌ Break her entire iOS app

## ✅ Safe Solution: Feature Branch Strategy

### Step 1: Create Feature Branch (Safe)
Create a new branch with your camera features:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/calorie-camera
```

### Step 2: Cherry-pick Safe Changes
Only add your NEW features (don't touch her iOS app):

```bash
# Add web app (NEW - safe)
git add src/ public/ package*.json next.config.js tsconfig.json

# Add Swift package (NEW - safe)
git add calorie-camera/

# Add demo iOS app (NEW - safe, separate from her app)
git add CalorieCameraHost/

# Add improved Supabase function (ENHANCED - review needed)
git add supabase/

# Add documentation (NEW - safe)
git add *.md .env.example

# Add config files (NEW - safe)
git add .github/ .vscode/ .gitignore

# Commit
git commit -m "feat: Add calorie camera feature with web app and Swift package

- Add Next.js web app for calorie tracking
- Add CalorieCameraKit Swift package with:
  - LiDAR depth capture
  - Vision framework segmentation
  - 3D volume estimation
  - Delta method uncertainty propagation
- Add CalorieCameraHost demo iOS app
- Enhance Supabase Edge Function with OpenAI integration
- Add comprehensive documentation

### Step 3: Push Feature Branch
```bash
git push friend feature/calorie-camera
```

### Step 4: Create Pull Request
Go to https://github.com/janicesc/HabitPet/pulls and create a PR from `feature/calorie-camera` → `main`

**PR Description**:
```markdown
# Add Calorie Camera Feature

## Overview
This PR adds the calorie camera feature with:
- ✅ Next.js web app for food calorie tracking
- ✅ CalorieCameraKit Swift package (can be integrated into HabitPet app)
- ✅ Demo iOS app showing how to use the package
- ✅ Enhanced Supabase Edge Function with AI analysis

## What's Added (NEW files only)
- `src/` - Next.js web app
- `public/` - Web assets
- `calorie-camera/` - Swift package for camera features
- `CalorieCameraHost/` - Demo iOS app (separate from HabitPet)
- `supabase/functions/analyze_food/` - Enhanced function
- Documentation files

## What's NOT Changed
- ✅ Your `HabitPet.xcodeproj` is untouched
- ✅ Your `HabitPet/` source files are untouched
- ✅ All your existing iOS code preserved

## How to Integrate Into HabitPet iOS App

### Option A: Use as Swift Package Dependency
Add to your HabitPet Xcode project:
1. File → Add Package Dependencies
2. Add local package: `./calorie-camera`
3. Import in your views: `import CalorieCameraKit`
4. Use: `CalorieCameraView(config: .default)`

### Option B: Copy Demo Code
Look at `CalorieCameraHost/` for example integration

## Testing
- All 28 Swift tests pass: `cd calorie-camera && swift test`
- Web app works: `npm run dev`
- Supabase function deployed and working

## Setup Required
See `SETUP_GUIDE.md` for complete setup instructions.
```

## 🔄 Alternative: Rebase Strategy (More Complex)

If you want to merge into her main branch later:

```bash
# Fetch latest from her repo
git fetch friend

# Create new branch from HER main
git checkout -b integration-branch friend/main

# Cherry-pick your changes (one by one)
git cherry-pick <commit-hash-for-web-app>
git cherry-pick <commit-hash-for-swift-package>
# etc...

# Resolve conflicts (keep her iOS app)
# Push when ready
git push friend integration-branch
```

## 📋 What She Needs to Do

After you push the feature branch:

1. **Review the PR**: Check that her HabitPet app is untouched
2. **Merge the PR**: This adds your camera features
3. **Integrate camera into her app**:
   - Option A: Add `calorie-camera` as package dependency
   - Option B: Copy code from `CalorieCameraHost` example
4. **Set up environment**:
   - Follow `SETUP_GUIDE.md`
   - Deploy Supabase secrets
   - Configure `.env.local`

## 🎯 Recommended Approach

**Use Feature Branch (Step 1-4 above)**:
- ✅ Safest approach
- ✅ She can review before merging
- ✅ No risk to her existing code
- ✅ Clear separation of features
- ✅ Can integrate gradually

## 🚨 What NOT to Do

❌ **Don't**: `git push friend main --force`
- This will delete her entire HabitPet iOS app

❌ **Don't**: Merge without reviewing
- Could accidentally delete her files

❌ **Don't**: Commit her iOS app changes
- You only worked on camera feature
