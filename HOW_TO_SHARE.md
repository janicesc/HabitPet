# How to Share Your Camera Feature with Janice

## ✅ Good News!
I've prepared your camera feature code safely on a branch called `feature/calorie-camera`. Her HabitPet iOS app files are preserved and won't be deleted.

## 🚫 Permission Issue
You don't have push access to her GitHub repo (this is normal and secure). Here are your options:

---

1. Go to https://github.com/janicesc/HabitPet
2. Click "Fork" button (top right)
3. This creates a copy at `https://github.com/Bingia01/HabitPet`

### Step 2: Add Your Fork as Remote
```bash
# Add your fork as a remote
git remote add myfork git@github.com:Bingia01/HabitPet.git

# Push to your fork
git push myfork feature/calorie-camera
```

### Step 3: Create Pull Request
1. Go to https://github.com/Bingia01/HabitPet
2. Click "Pull requests" → "New pull request"
3. Set base to: `janicesc/HabitPet` (main)

## Option 2: Ask Her to Add You as Collaborator

git push friend feature/calorie-camera
```

## Option 3: Share as Patch Files

Create patch files she can apply:

```bash
# Create patches for your 3 commits
git format-patch friend/main..feature/calorie-camera -o patches/

# This creates 3 files:
# patches/0001-fix-CalorieCameraKit-bug-fixes.patch
# patches/0002-docs-Add-comprehensive-setup.patch
# patches/0003-chore-Preserve-HabitPet-iOS-app.patch
```

Send her the `patches/` folder. She applies them with:
```bash
git am patches/*.patch
```

---

## Option 4: Direct Handoff (In Person)

If you can meet in person:

```bash
# Create a bundle file (single file with all changes)
git bundle create camera-feature.bundle friend/main..feature/calorie-camera

# Give her camera-feature.bundle file
```

She extracts it with:
```bash
git bundle verify camera-feature.bundle
git fetch camera-feature.bundle feature/calorie-camera:feature/calorie-camera
git checkout feature/calorie-camera
```
